# Distribution Fitting

This R code uses the R *poweRlaw* package to figure out which distribution fits best to a given data-set of a graph.
The R poweRlaw package is an implementation of maximum likelihood estimators as described in [1] that supports power-law, log-normal, Poisson, and exponential distributions.
